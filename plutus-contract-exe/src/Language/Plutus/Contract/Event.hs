{-
    Event-based interface between contract executables and the app platform and
    (by extension) the wallet.

    Two types of events are defined:

    1. 'ContractOut'. Events produced by the contract for consumption by app
       platform and wallet. Includes transactions and instructions to start
       watching interesting addresses on the ledger.

    2. 'LedgerUpdate'. Events that inform the contract about changes to the
       ledger state.

    Contracts will offer an HTTP interface with the following routes.

    * 1 route "initialise" to get the list of endpoints and interesting
      addresses at the start of the instance
    * 1 route "update" to advance the contract to the next state given some
      input (user interaction or blockchain)
